Jupyter
Jupyter, previously known as IPython Notebook, is a web-based, interac-
tive development environment. Originally developed for Python, it has since
expanded to support over 40 other programming languages including Julia
and R.
Jupyter allows for notebooks to be written that contain text, live code, images,
and equations. These notebooks can be shared, and can even be hosted on
GitHub for free.
For each section of this tutorial, you can download a Juypter notebook that
allows you to edit and experiment with the code and examples for each topic.
Jupyter is part of the Anaconda distribution, it can be started from the command
line using using the jupyter command
